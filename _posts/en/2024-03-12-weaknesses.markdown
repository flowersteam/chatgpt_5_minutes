description: "<p>Language Models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Mistral, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for a wide range of tasks. However, they also have numerous limitations and weaknesses! In this video, we explain the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language Models are trained on data of varying quality and origin. The selection of this data is often not precisely controlled.</li>
<li>This data, and thus the Language Models, can contain \"biases\", meaning an automatic way of thinking that is not based on reasoning or facts. These biases can be unfair and reinforce stereotypes. If these biases are not controlled, they will be reflected in the output and usage of these models.</li>
